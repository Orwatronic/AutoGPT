# CURSOR RULES FOR AUTOGPT REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT INTELLIGENCE PROJECT

## üéØ CRITICAL GLOBAL RULE
**Always verify and confirm the target directory before creating any new files.** If the requested directory doesn't exist, confirm with the user whether to create it, or if it's meant to be in an existing path.

## File Organization Rules

### 1. NEVER create files in the root directory unless explicitly specified
- Root directory is ONLY for: README.md, .gitignore, .cursorrules, package files, architecture docs
- All project files must go in appropriate subdirectories

### 2. Directory Structure Enforcement
- `/real-estate-mvp/scrapers/` = Data collection scripts (bayut_scraper.py, etc.)
- `/real-estate-mvp/analysis/` = AI analysis engines (ai_investment_analyzer.py, etc.)  
- `/real-estate-mvp/reports/` = Generated reports and outputs
- `/real-estate-mvp/data/` = Property data files (.json)
- `/real-estate-mvp/autogpt_blocks/` = Custom AutoGPT blocks
- `/real-estate-mvp/rag/` = RAG components (vector stores, embeddings, retrievers)
- `/project-tracker/` = Project documentation and tracking
- `/.cursor/rules/` = Cursor AI configuration and guidelines

### 3. File Creation Protocol
BEFORE creating any file, explicitly specify the full path:
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `real-estate-mvp/scrapers/new_scraper.py`
- ‚ùå WRONG: `new_scraper.py` (defaults to root)
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `real-estate-mvp/analysis/new_analyzer.py` 
- ‚ùå WRONG: `new_analyzer.py` (defaults to root)

### 4. Pre-Creation Checklist
Before creating any file, ask:
1. What is the PURPOSE of this file?
2. Which DIRECTORY should it be in based on purpose?
3. Does the directory exist? (create if needed)
4. Am I specifying the FULL PATH including subdirectory?

### 5. Naming Conventions
- Scrapers: `*_scraper.py` 
- Analyzers: `*_analyzer.py`
- RAG Components: `*_retriever.py`, `*_embedder.py`
- AutoGPT Blocks: `*_block.py`
- Reports: `*_report_YYYYMMDD.txt`
- Data: `*_data_YYYYMMDD.json`

### 6. Movement Protocol  
If a file is created in wrong location:
1. Immediately identify the mistake
2. Move to correct location using `move` command with `-Force`
3. Update any references/imports
4. Test functionality in new location

```

### 8. Enforcement
- ALWAYS double-check file location after creation
- If file appears in root when it shouldn't be there, IMMEDIATELY move it
- Reference this file before creating any new files
