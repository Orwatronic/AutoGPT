# AutoGPT Project - Daily Progress Log

## 📅 June 25, 2025 - Day 1: Initial Setup & Exploration

### 🎯 **Today's Objectives**
- Clone and explore AutoGPT repository
- Set up development environment
- Get AutoGPT Platform running
- Test with OpenAI API integration

### ✅ **Completed Tasks**

#### **1. Repository Setup (Windows PowerShell)**
- ✅ Successfully cloned AutoGPT repository from GitHub
- ✅ Explored repository structure (Platform vs Classic versions)
- ✅ Identified 50+ pre-built blocks for automation

#### **2. Environment Analysis**
- ✅ Analyzed system requirements:
  - Node.js v22.11.0 ✅
  - npm v10.9.0 ✅
  - Docker Desktop (installed during session) ✅
  - WSL2 backend configured ✅
- ✅ OpenAI API key configured in backend `.env` file

#### **3. Docker & Backend Services**
- ✅ Successfully installed Docker Desktop for Windows
- ✅ Started all 27 AutoGPT Platform backend services
- ✅ Verified database migrations completed
- ✅ Confirmed WSL2 integration working properly

#### **4. Learning & Discovery**
- ✅ Understood AutoGPT architecture:
  - Backend: Python/FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Supabase
  - Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
  - Execution: Docker containers with WSL2
- ✅ Discovered available integrations (50+ blocks):
  - Web scraping, social media, AI/ML, business tools
  - Google, GitHub, Discord, Reddit, Medium, etc.

### ❌ **Challenges Encountered**

#### **1. Frontend Startup Issues**
- **Problem**: Next.js dev server took extremely long to start (5+ minutes)
- **Cause**: Large TypeScript codebase compilation on first run
- **Lesson**: First-time Next.js builds require patience, subsequent runs are faster

#### **2. Directory Navigation Confusion**
- **Problem**: Ran `npm run dev` from wrong directory (root instead of frontend)
- **Cause**: Path confusion between root and frontend directories
- **Solution**: Always verify current directory before running commands

#### **3. Corepack Permission Issues**
- **Problem**: `corepack enable` failed due to Windows permissions
- **Solution**: Used npm instead of pnpm for frontend dependencies
- **Lesson**: Administrator privileges required for global package manager changes

#### **4. .env File Security Restrictions**
- **Problem**: AI assistant blocked from directly editing `.env` files
- **Reason**: Security feature to protect sensitive credentials
- **Solution**: Manual editing through Notepad/text editor

### 🧠 **Key Technical Learnings**

#### **Docker & WSL2 Understanding**
- **WSL2 Backend**: Confirmed by kernel version `6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2`
- **Container Architecture**: 27 microservices working together
- **Port Management**: Backend (8000), Frontend (3000), Supabase dashboard (8000)

#### **AutoGPT Architecture**
- **Modern Platform**: Visual drag-and-drop agent builder
- **Classic Version**: Command-line based traditional approach
- **Execution Environment**: Docker containers with isolated services

#### **Development Environment**
- **Environment Variables**: Separate `.env` files for different services
- **Package Management**: Both npm and pnpm supported via corepack
- **API Integration**: Multiple AI providers supported (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, etc.)

### 📊 **Current Status**
- **Backend Services**: ✅ Successfully running (then stopped for cleanup)
- **Frontend**: ❌ Not yet accessible (startup issues)
- **API Configuration**: ✅ OpenAI key configured
- **Environment**: ✅ Fully set up and ready

### 🎯 **Next Session Goals**
1. **Fix Frontend Startup**
   - Investigate slow Next.js compilation
   - Get web interface accessible on localhost:3000
   
2. **Create First Agent**
   - Use drag-and-drop interface
   - Test with simple automation task
   
3. **Explore Alternative Approaches**
   - Try AutoGPT Classic if Platform continues having issues
   - Build simple custom automation script

### 💭 **Project Direction Questions**
- Should we focus on Platform (GUI) or Classic (code-based)?
- What type of automation would be most valuable to build?
- Alternative: Start with simpler automation tools?

### 🔧 **Environment Details**
- **OS**: Windows 10.0.22631
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **Node**: v22.11.0
- **Docker**: Desktop with WSL2 backend
- **Repository**: C:\Fra_Asus_til_MSI\VSCode\AutoGPT
